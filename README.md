May 2021, Home Assignment for CrazyHubs India.

This is our attempt at making a game, not the most polished game, but definitely an honest attempt. 

RoachRun is a runner that works on simple left-right movement mechanics but instead of a straight platform it works in a 360 tunnel! Follow the journey of the cockroach down a sewage pipe and help it find Food! 

The game can follow a lot of other themes like skateboarding in a tunnel, snowboard, drift cars among several others. The game has potential, a very interesting idea. However, we struggled with the execution of the idea. Nevertheless, we present to you our attempt at making it. We hope to get better with your support.
